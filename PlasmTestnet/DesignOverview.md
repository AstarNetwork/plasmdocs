# Plasm Testnet Design

> Main aim of Plasm Testnet is experimental network for community integration and public tests.

## Versioning

- spec-name: plasm-testnet
- impl-name: plasm-testnet-node

Version naming notion:

- For authoring version, it just equals to the testnet generation spec, testnet generation will not change authoring interface.
- For spec/impl versions, two numbers are used, the high number is for testnet generation, the low number for testnet runtime upgrades (probably we will have no more than 9 patch fixes for testnet generation). Example: 10 for Testnet v1 genesis, 21 for Testnet v2 patch 1.

Testnet generation could be or not compatible with old network. However, a periodic testnet blockchain wipe is not a bad thing, as it helps reducing the required resources for testnet participants.

**Estimated life cycle for testnet generation is approximately from two weeks to two months.**

## Testnet migration guidelines

Testnet upgrade could be two types:

- major upgrade
- minor runtime patch

For the major upgrade the high version number is changed and testnet version is increased. This mean that testnet started from scratch. Major updates could be used for introducing breakable features or blockchain wipes for network participants' resource-saving.

Runtime upgrade is acceptable for minor patches, end-users should not notice a change of this upgrade. Itâ€™s an easy way to introduce small, non breakable features/patches for the network.

# Dusty Plasm

This is Plasm `canary` network, it looks like `beta` of Mainnet.
**Dusty** predict mainnet runtime source code for 1-2 weeks.

## Incentives

Yes, Dusty network participation is incentivized by default.
Dusty pay rewards in PLD (network native token) for each PoA validator and DApp operator nominators.

> When Plasm Network token distribution finish Stake Technologies team plan distribute **0.5%** of Plasm tokens for Dusty token holders.

Planned features:
- Multi-lockdrop
- Optimistic Virtual Machine
