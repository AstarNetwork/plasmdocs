# Overview

The Astar Staking Festival will launch in the first **** week of launching Astar! ðŸš€&#x20;

The main reason for this cool event is to educate our community around dApp staking. After our Staking Festival, we will launch dApp staking with the projects that are built on Astar Network at that time. The Staking Festival will give you more insight into dApp staking and our build2earn protocol with the same look & feel.

## What is dApp staking? <a href="#4965" id="4965"></a>

The simplify the concept we can compare this with staking on validators but instead of staking to validators, users can choose to nominate their Astar/Shiden tokens on the project. These users are also known as nominators. At every block, half of your block rewards go to dApp staking. This reward is further divided into a 50/50 ratio between operators (developers) and nominators.

25% of total block rewards is a huge incentive for dApp developers to build in the Astar ecosystem. In other blockchains like Ethereum, dApp developers need to apply for grant programs, issuance of tokens, fundraising, etc. to earn some money. In the Astar ecosystem, as long as your dApp has been nominated, you will receive some basic income. As your dApp grows in popularity, more members of the community will nominate you and this means that you will receive a greater percentage of the block reward!

We must also not forget the nominators. 25% reward is quite substantial and can serve as an alternative to staking to validators or lending on other DeFi platforms.

During the Stake2Earn Festival, the ratio of staker:pool is set to 99:1! Giving everyone a high APY on staked tokens from the first moment they join staking! The event will run until dApp staking is fully ready to be deployed on Astar. With using the 99:1 parameter a total of 49,5% of all block rewards go to staking in one of our pools.

## Staking pools <a href="#9daa" id="9daa"></a>

For you, as a user, it doesn't matter what pool you use for staking. The return for staking in a pool is the same. Each pool is managed by one of our Ambassadors or Core-Team member.

* Each pool can have a max of **512 stakers**.
* The minimum amount to stake is **500 ASTR.**  (+500 ASTR was the basic reward for 5 DOT during the crowdloan and minimum contribution)
* Every ERA you can claim your rewards, please note that it doesnâ€™t have to be you to press the claim button. If the pool owner or anyone else from the stake pool presses the claim button, you will also get your ERA rewards. If you cant click on the claim, there is nothing you need to do.
