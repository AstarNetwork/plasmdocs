# Transfer ASTR from exchanges to your wallet

As you all know having assets on a CEX has its limitations. One important note is that you don't have control over your wallet's private key. To have full control over your funds you need to transfer them to a wallet you control and own.&#x20;

## Astar Native wallet

Before you withdraw your $ASTR tokens from an exchange, make sure you have control over an Astar native wallet. If you don't know how to do this, see the previous page.

## Use your Astar native address

Please go to the[ Astar portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/balance/wallet) and connect your Polkadot.js. Once you are connected to the Astar portal, you will be able to see your address and amount.

Make sure to copy your **Native** address. This is the address that you should use when you withdraw ASTR from exchanges.

## Withdraw

The final step is very easy and most likely you already did before on an exchange. Go to your assets find Astar and click on **withdraw**. In your withdrawal window, you paste your Astar native wallet and now you are ready to send your $ASTR to your wallet under your control.
