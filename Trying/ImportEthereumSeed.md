> Prepare your Ethereum Lockdrop account seed (hex-string or mnemonic). [Metamask guide](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key).

Let's create account in Plasm Network using your seed at **Accounts** -> **Add account**:

Please choose **ECDSA** type of keypair and hex-string for seed (if you export Metamask key by [guide](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key)).
