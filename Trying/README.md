What are the functionalities of Plasm Testnet?
On top of all the existing modules for Substrate, Plasm Testnet has three additional features.
- Operator Trading
    - This focuses on managing the Contract owner. Additionally, it can tokenize Contracts, which means it allows the transfer of ownership of the Contract!
- Dapps Rewards
    - As the name suggests, this focuses on the reward system for Dapps (including Plasm Applications) developer. This is a blockchain-specific monetization model for the Web3.0. We dare say it is the monetization model for the next generation.
- Multi-Lockdrop
    - Lockdrop is a method for distributing tokens. Participants lock their tokens from existing blockchains (like DOT or ETH) for a certain duration. Next, we distribute the tokens to the locked participants and take the opportunity cost that comes from locking a token as collateral. A Multi-Lockdrop is when we repeat this multiple times to distribute the native token with value to a massive number of token holders.
