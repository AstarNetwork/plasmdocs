# The Problems Plasm Solves ðŸŒ¾

[Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) is a layer1 blockchain that solves prominent issues: scalability and interoperability. 

## Scalability

Blockchain does't scale by design because of decentralized consensus mechanism. TPS \(Transaction Per Second\) is much smaller than a centralized data base and there is an upper limitation of data that can be stored in every block. Therefore, users across the network may notice their transactions sit as unconfirmed or pending for a longer period of time, and we understand this makes user experience worse. 

When we say "scalability", [Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) is addressing the followings topics.

* More Transaction Per Second \(TPS\)
* Cheaper transaction cost
* Faster finality

### Interoperability

Currently, many blockchains are created but few blockchains have interoperability as a feature.  For example, to move "value" from Bitcoin to Ethereum, we need some sorts of centralized exchanges. Polkadot is a sharded protocol that enables blockchain networks to operate together seamlessly. 

[Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) is compatible with Polkadot. By connecting [Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) to Polkadot, we will have a true interoperability.
