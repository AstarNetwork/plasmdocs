# Bonus Scheme

## Overview <a href="#2859" id="2859"></a>

Almost exactly five years after the vision of a heterogeneous multichain framework was first outlined in the Polkadot Whitepaper (aka the Polkadot Paper), parachains are now officially ready for launch on Polkadot. The news that Polkadot is now technically capable of supporting its first parachains was announced on October 13th, 2021, by Polkadot founders Gavin Wood and Robert Habermeier. The announcement was followed by a motion for Polkadot Council to open up the network’s first parachain slot auctions, proposed to begin on November 11th, 2021.

Astar Network is ready to join the auctions on Polkadot. We are happy to introduce **Astar Crowdloan Event.**

## Parachain Slot Auctions <a href="#7638" id="7638"></a>

Parachains connect to Polkadot by leasing a slot on the Relay Chain for up to 96 weeks at a time, with the option to renew. Parachain slots are assigned by an on-chain auction, with auction winners locking up a bond in DOT for the duration of the lease. Auctions and crowdloans raise the bar for blockchain projects, incentivizing them to demonstrate their technology and gain community support prior to launch.

Users would be able to stake their DOT’s through our crowdloan page. Astar made sure the experience is very easy for users to start staking their DOT in our crowdloan event.

## Parachain tokenomics <a href="#ee91" id="ee91"></a>

This will be shared in the upcoming article (Astar Crowdloan Event Part II). Released before the start of the Polkadot crowdloan.

## Reward scheme <a href="#4737" id="4737"></a>

Astar will change the strategy for the Polkadot auctions. One of the biggest reasons for changing was that the Kusama strategy was very hard for users to understand. The bonus rate wasn’t easy to calculate and missed users joining our crowdloan. We changed the strategy for the Astar Crowdloan Event and use a fixed amount for each DOT invested. **This amount is the minimum amount for every staker to receive.**

**For example: 13 ASTR / 5 DOT.**

More information about the exact fixed number for each DOT will be provided in the second part of this article series.

> The minimum amount to join the Astar Crowdloan Event is 5 DOT. A minimum contribution amount is necessary to prevent spam and to facilitate the smooth operation of the crowdloan mechanism. The mimimum amount is set by Parity.
