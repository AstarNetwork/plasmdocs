# Unlock vested tokens

## Overview

If you joined the crowdloan, we want to thank you for your support. Because of your support we became the third parachain on Kusama and are working on making the dApp platform on Kusama that supports EVM, WASM, and layer2 solutions.&#x20;

As you know, at the end of the crowdloan your tokens got locked for one month and will have a vesting period of 10 months. The vesting phase started at block [#200,000](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Shiden). &#x20;

## How vesting works

{% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial is built for users who joined the crowdloan through polkadot.js.org or can export their wallets to this website. If you received your tokens on CEX you need to ask their support on how vesting will work on their platform.

Go to [your wallet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fshiden.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts) and load your account.\
When your account is loaded you will see your tokens and how many are locked, vested, or transferrable:

Click on the three dots next to 'send' where you can 'Unlock vested amount'. When you click on this, you need to confirm and sign the transaction. After this, your vested tokens and now transferrable!
