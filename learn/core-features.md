# Core Features üè°

 On top of all the existing modules for Substrate, Plasm testnet has three additional features.

### **Operator Trading**

This focuses on managing the Contract owner. Additionally, it can tokenize Contracts, which means it allows the transfer of ownership of the Contract!

### **Dapps Rewards**

As the name suggests, this focuses on the reward system for Dapps \(including Plasm Applications\) developer. This is a blockchain-specific monetization model for the Web3.0. We dare say it is the monetization model for the next generation.

### **Multi-Lockdrop**

Lockdrop is a method for distributing tokens. Participants lock their tokens from existing blockchains \(like DOT or ETH\) for a certain duration. Next, we distribute the tokens to the locked participants and take the opportunity cost that comes from locking a token as collateral. A Multi-Lockdrop is when we repeat this multiple times to distribute the native token with value to a massive number of token holders.
