# Kusama Parachain Auction Strategy

## **What is Shiden Network?** <a id="fab4"></a>

Shiden Network is a canary network that acts as an R&D chain of Plasm Network. 

### Parachain Auction

One of the initial goals of Shiden Network is to become a Kusama Parachain. We will distribute 32.5% of SDN tokens to KSM lockdrop participants \(Parachain Lease Offering\) with a vesting period.

“Lockdrops” means that participants who joined our previous ETH lockdrop and who successfully claimed the PLM tokens could get SDN tokens at the Shiden Network genesis. This will be at a 1:1 ratio.

## **Kusama Parachain Auction** <a id="0e35"></a>

Today, we are technically ready to join the Kusama auction and build dApps hub on Kusama. To become one of the first Kusama Parachains, we will conduct a KSM lockdrop.

KSM holders can directly participate in the auction from our portal. All you need to do is connect your Polkadot.js extension to the portal, select the locking amount and click on “Deposit.”

* Lease period: 2 years
* No maximum KSM, no minimum
* **SDN** is capped during the Kusama parachain auction, 32,5% of the total supply will be distributed.
