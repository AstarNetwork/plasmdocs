### **How many SDN will I get for joining the KSM PLO?**

This depends on the lease/lock period of KSM and a few other factors such as total locked KSM. The token allocation for the PLO is capped and we will distribute a total of around 30% of our token supply to those who join the PLO.

### **What does it mean to unbond my KSM, and how do I do it?**

When nominating on Kusama, you have a delayed exit period, called the unbonding period, which serves as a cooldown. You will not be able to transfer your tokens before this period has elapsed. Read more and find instructions on the [Kusama wiki](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-unbond).  
****

### **Do I have to unbond my KSM if they are on an exchange?**

Not necessarily. You need to contact your exchange to find out how to participate directly on the exchange. In case it is not supported on your exchange, you would need to unbound, transfer your KSM to Polkadot-js extension wallet and use one of the methods to participate, which, we will announce closer to the launch of the PLO.  
****

### **How long will the KSM tokens be locked?**

Your KSM will be locked for the full duration of the Shiden parachain lease. This is a yet-to-be-determined \(6, 12, 18, and 24 months\).  
****

### **Will my KSM be returned after the parachain lease ends?**

Yes, your KSM will be unlocked but you need to claim them back.  
****

### **When will I receive my Shiden tokens?**

When we win the auction on Kusama you will receive your SDN tokens in your wallet. Be aware that those SDN tokens you mint during the PLO have a vesting period during the lease period. SDN will be released linearly closer to the end of the lease period.  
****

### **What if Shiden doesnâ€™t win the parachain auction?**

If Shiden does not win the auction, your KSM will be automatically returned immediately but Shiden aims to become the first one.  
****

### **What is the difference between the Plasm PLO on Polkadot and the Shiden PLO on Kusama?**

Shiden PLO is on Kusama and will function as Plasm canary network. For participants, the key differences are that the parachain lease duration for Shiden may be different and likely to be shorter than Plasm. Also, participants in the Plasm PLO on Polkadot will receive PLM, whereas participants in the Shiden PLO on Kusama will receive SDN tokens.
