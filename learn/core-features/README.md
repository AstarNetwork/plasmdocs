# Core Features

The Plasm Network has three additional features in addition to the existing Substrate modules:

## **Operator Trading**

This is enhanced smart contract owner management which allows the tokenization of contracts and transfer of contract ownership.

## **dApps Rewards**

This is the reward system for dApps \(including Plasm Applications\) developers. It is a blockchain-specific monetization model for the Web3.0 and maybe even the next generation.

## **Multi-Lockdrop**

Lockdrop is a method for distributing tokens. Participants lock tokens from other blockchains \(DOT, KSM, or ETH\) for a certain duration. Native tokens are then distributed to participants and the opportunity cost that comes is taken as collateral. Repeat this multiple times to distribute the native token with value to a massive number of token holders.
