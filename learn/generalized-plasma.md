# Generalized Plasma

## Plasma Group Specification \(PGSpec\)

Plasma PGSpec is the latest Plasma standard specification proposed by the Plasma Group. The official name is "Plasma Group â€™s Generalized Plasma Specification".

The official specifications for PGSpec can be found [here.](https://docs.plasma.group/projects/spec/en/latest)

Before PGSpec, Plasma's application was limited to payments and asset exchanges. None of these designs are as versatile as smart contracts. The Plasma Group designed a more general Plasma chain specification for more use cases. This makes it possible to develop a Plasma Chain that can be used not only for currency exchange, but also for a wide range of use cases, such as handling games and financial services, which requires a high transaction throughput in order for it to be usable.

## OVM

The Plasma Group is researching and developing an abstract language structure called the Optimistic Virtual Machine, which can be used to host every layer 2 solutions that is implemented. Currently Plasm Network implements an OVM that is in its early stage. Leveraging an OVM means that Plasm is able to use other layer 2 protocols other than Plasma.

## Word of Gratitude

We have a partnership with one of the most advanced Plasma implementers; [Cryptoeconomics Lab](https://www.cryptoeconomicslab.com/). We appreciate all the developments and contributions they have done in the Plasma ecosystem.
