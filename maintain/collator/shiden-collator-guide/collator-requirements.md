# Collator Requirements

There are multiple ways to set up a server where you can run your collator node. Just make sure you understand the purpose of a collator and the responsibilities.

We recommend you first read the documentation about running collators.

**Minimum configuration:**

Make sure you only use your server for running the collator!
{% endhint %}

* System: Linux (macOS possible)
* Bare Metal server dedicated to the collator node
* CPU: 8 physical cores
* Memory: 16 GB
* Hard Disk: 250 GB SSD NVMe (storage space will increase with time)

**NOTE**: Shibuya is the perfect network to test out your knowledge about running nodes in the Astar ecosystem. To join the collator set on Shibuya you need to apply for a 32k SBY fund.

If you never operated a collator node, we strongly encourage you to spin up a **Shibuya collator** node to start before thinking about mainnet.
