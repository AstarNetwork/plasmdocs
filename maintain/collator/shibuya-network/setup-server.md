# Collator Requirements

There are multiple ways to set up a server where you can run your collator node. Just make sure you understand the purpose of a collator and the responsibilities.

We recommend you first read the documentation about running collators.

**NOTE**: Shibuya is the perfect network to test out your knowledge about running nodes in the Astar ecosystem. To join the collator set on Shibuya you need to apply for a 32k SBY fund.

The requirement to get the fund:

* Your node is visible on [Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/0xddb89973361a170839f80f152d2e9e38a376a5a7eccefcade763f46a8e567019).
* On-Chain identity is required with your Discord ID in the field of 'Legal Name'.
* Node is fully synced with the Relay Chain and Shibuya network.
* **Uptime of 14 days!**
