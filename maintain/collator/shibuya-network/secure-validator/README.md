# Secure Collator Setup

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial requires a certain technical background if you don't have any background please follow this guide carefully and use Google to learn more about what you are doing.
{% endhint %}

The **Astar/Shiden ecosystem** has raised incredible attention in the past few months, and this is just the beginning. Many individuals joined the adventure and set up their own **collator node**, which is great for decentralization. Running a collator on a mainnet is a lot of **responsibility**!

We recommend monitoring your validator and setting up alerts in case something is going wrong with your server. As a future Astar/Shiden collator, this monitoring is mandatory.&#x20;

This guide is based on [the guide made by one of our ambassadors](https://bldstackingnode.medium.com/monitoring-substrate-node-polkadot-kusama-parachains-validator-guide-922734ea4cdb#efff), [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node), [W3F secure validator repo](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-secure-validator). Creating the ultimate guide to secure your validator.

## Understanding

A validator or collator in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem plays an essential role in Aster/Shiden network and is responsible for crucial tasks, including block production and transaction confirmation. A collator needs to maintain a high communication response capability to ensure seamless operation of the network. It is also necessary for them to establish a good reputation in the community to attract more nominators who nominate their tokens to improve the networkâ€™s security. Based on network affordability and security considerations, validator seats will gradually open after the launch of Plasm/Shiden.

As a future validator, it's very important that you know what you are doing. I don't want to encourage you to move forward but it's important to understand that running a collator comes with responsibility. Also, who doesn't want to learn something new? Reading, learning, understanding, and setting things up would take between **2-4 hours**.&#x20;
