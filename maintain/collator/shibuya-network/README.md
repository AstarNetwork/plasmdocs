# Testnet collator guide

**Astar Network** has 2 mainnet parachains: **** [**Astar**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.astar.network#/accounts) **** connected to **Polkadot** and [**Shiden**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fshiden.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/accounts) **** connected to **Kusama**.

****[**Shibuya** ](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.shibuya.astar.network#/accounts)is our testnet parachain, it is connected to a custom relaychain named **Tokyo** which is maintained by Astar core team.&#x20;

Shibuya is the Astar Network's parachain testnet with EVM functionalities which is the closest to the Shiden and Astar mainnet. Shibuya has almost the exact chain specifications and creates the best test environment for developers who want to launch their dApp on mainnet.
