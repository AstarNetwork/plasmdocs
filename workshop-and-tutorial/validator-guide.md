# Validator Guide

Thanks to our community we have several tutorials you can use to become a validator on Plasm Testnet.

* Install Dusty on your local device
* Install Dusty on a VPS server \([Microsoft Azure](https://fiex.medium.com/plasm-node-on-azure-32ec5a204b45), [Digital Ocean](https://fiex.medium.com/become-a-plasm-network-validator-c212085cc72e), ...\)

To become a validator, follow these steps:

1. Run a node on Dusty network.
2. Claim tokens for transactions by requesting them on [the Discord](https://discord.gg/Z3nC9U4) **\#faucet** channel.
3. Get your `rotateKey()` and connect this to your validator account.
4. Share your validator account address with **Stake Technologies** team via [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSday0ckkK43TzJgKtQmJdzkudQNFDXspZAuUGi5Y5vfjkis3Q/viewform).

## Conclusion

When you finish this tutorial, please wait a bit while **Stake Technologies** team approves your account as a validator. Thank you for Plasm Network contribution and let's make Plasm better together!

If you have already participated in testnet V3 as a validator, you could be interested in migration. Please copy your session keys from **testnet v3 keystore** into **dusty keystore** by following commands before launch node:exit: Ctrl+â†©

```text
mkdir .local/share/plasm-node/chains/dustycp -r .local/share/plasm-node/chains/plasm_testnet_v3/keystore .local/share/plasm-node/chains/dusty
```
