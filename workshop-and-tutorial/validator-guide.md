* Open Toolbox window and call `rotateKeys()` RPC call or use curl command:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "author_rotateKeys", "params":[]}' http://localhost:9933
```

```text
mkdir .local/share/plasm-node/chains/dustycp -r .local/share/plasm-node/chains/plasm_testnet_v3/keystore .local/share/plasm-node/chains/dusty
