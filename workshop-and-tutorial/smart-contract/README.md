# Layer1 Smart Contract

[Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) supports smart contracts on the layer1. In this tutorial,  we will learn how to write, deploy, and interact with your smart contract on Plasm Network.

### Introduction

As we learned on the Substrate chapter,  Plasm Network is based on Substrate. Hence, we support ink!, an [eDSL](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) to write WebAssembly based smart contracts using the Rust programming language.

Parity technologies made an ink! tutorial and we can refer to this page: [https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/\#/](https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/)
