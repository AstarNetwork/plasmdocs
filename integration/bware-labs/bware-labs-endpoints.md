# Bware Labs Endpoints



The goal of Bware Labs is to build a decentralized platform where Full Node owners and Endpoint users such as developers and organizations are able to collaborate in a secure and trustful manner.&#x20;

### Overview

A common error if many users are using the same RPC endpoints is that you get an error while trying to connect. There is an easy fix to solve this. Create your own endpoint that only you use. We have several API partners that can offer these services to the users of our community. One of them is [Bware Labs](https://bwarelabs.com).

### Step 1

Launch their app on:

{% embed url="https://app.bwarelabs.com" %}

### Step 2

Connect to your MetaMask. This is to prevent users from spamming the network. You only need to connect to create an account in their app.

### **Step 3**

Now you can create your API endpoint. Click on **'API Endpoints**' and select Shiden Network.

Name your endpoint and choose the correct network. Shiden Mainnet on Kusama or our one for our testnet Shibuya. Sign the message and wait for your endpoint to be created.

### Step 4

After your endpoint is created, you can use the RPC Endpoint to connect to Shiden Network through MetaMask or the WSS Endpoint to be used for other applications. Those endpoints are only for you to be used.

How to add your endpoint to MetaMask:

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click on Custom RPC
3. Add all the information (see screenshot)
