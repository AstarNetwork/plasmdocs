# Operator Trading

Operator trading is a mechanism to buy and sell the right to be a Plasma operator. Since the right is tradable, this is similar to M&A. A Plasma operator gets constant basic income by creating Plapps owning to Plasm treasury. If the Plapp is meaningful for the community, the creator receives higher revenue. As a result, other players may want the right to operate the Plapp. The successor will receive the reward instead of a previous operator. The important thing is that the buyer does not need to take over the operation itself though the buyer has ownership. Through this mechanism, we assume that the new off-chain market will be created.
