# Our Journey

We started making Plasm Network back in 2019. Since then, we have delivered many technical advancements and products in the Polkadot ecosystem. So far, it has been a great journey, but we are still at the very early stage of achieving the Web 3.0 vision.

Before the upcoming Parachain auctions on Kusama and Polkadot, I think it is a good time to look back on our journey and announce the next steps.

## Technical Achievements — Grant <a id="1b8e"></a>

One of the achievements we are proud of is that we have delivered 4 Web3 Foundation grants out of 7 total grants that we received. Receiving a grant and delivering a grant are two different things. Delivering a grant is much more challenging than receiving it. 

Some people may be interested in why we are implementing Rollups on Polkadot even though Polkadot itself is already a scaling solution. While Polkadot provides scalability for blockchains in general, Plasm Network is the layer 1 platform for smart contracts that includes Rollups solutions.

In the coming months, we believe many Ethereum projects will use Rollups since Ethereum2.0 will take some time to complete. These projects that use Rollups can migrate from Ethereum to Astar Network or make a multi-chain application without compromising their Rollups contracts on Ethereum.

As a reference, I have listed up our grants in order.

* Plasma module on Substrate \(delivered\)
* ink! playground grant \(delivered\)
* Optimistic Virtual Machine grant \(In progress\)
* ECDSA implementation grant \(delivered\)
* ECDSA for hardware wallet grant \(delivered\)
* ZK Rollups and Plonk grant \(In progress\)

## Technical Achievements in 2021 — Parachain <a id="7321"></a>

Astar Network is a Polkadot Parachain candidate that acts as a dApps hub that supports multi virtual machines and layer 2 scaling solutions. In preparation for Astar Network becoming a parachain on Polkadot, we have made the following technical achievements on Rococo, the parachain testnet:

* Became the first Polkadot testnet Parachain \(Jan 13th\)
* Deployed the first WASM smart contracts on Polkadot testnet. \(Jan 31st\)
* Completed the first-ever cross-chain message transaction on Polkadot testnet with Acala’s testnet parachain.
* Ethereum Virtual Machine support added to the Plasm Network testnet parachain on Rococo.
* Shiden became a Kusama parachain.

Lastly, I would like to talk about our ecosystem updates.

* [OKEx announced investment in Plasm Network](https://medium.com/plasm-network/okex-invests-in-plasm-network-209851969261)
* Graduated from LongHash acceleration program
* Became a batch 1 member of Substrate Builders Program
* Conducted two lockdrops, and 150,000 ETH was locked on our smart contract
* Graduated from UC Berkeley Xcelerator Program
* Became a sponsor of the UC Berkeley Xcelerator Program
* [Raised $10M led by Fenbushi and Huobi](https://medium.com/astar-network/plasm-shidens-stake-technologies-closes-10m-strategic-fundraise-to-build-multi-chain-dapp-hub-8fe799473f51)

## Next Steps <a id="a19d"></a>

* Polkadot Parachain Auction participation
* Complete Optimistic Virtual Machine implementation
* Complete ZK Rollups Substrate pallet implementation
* Launch the Plasm Portal and dApps Staking

It has been an incredible journey, but we are still in the early stage of the Web3.0 movement. Together with our ecosystem members, we will do our best to build Web3.0.

Let’s make the future of Web3.0 today!
