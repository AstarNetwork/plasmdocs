# Secure Validator Setup

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
This tutorial requires a certain technical background if you don't have any background please follow this guide carefully and use Google to learn more about what you are doing.

Before joining Plasm/Shiden mainnet, it's great to test everything out on our testnet 'Dusty', build up your skills.
{% endhint %}

The **Plasm/Shiden ecosystem** has raised incredible attention in the past few months, and this is just the beginning. Many individuals joined the adventure and set up their own **validator node**, which is great for decentralization. Running a validator on a mainnet is a lot of **responsibility**! You will be accountable for not only your own stake, but also the stake of your current nominators. If you make a mistake and get slashed, your money and your reputation will be at risk. **However**, running a validator can also be very rewarding, knowing that you contribute to the security of a decentralized network while growing your stash.

We recommend monitoring your validator and set up alerts in case something is going wrong with your server. As a future Plasm/Shiden validator and want to use our Azure services, this monitoring is mandatory. 

This guide is based on [the guide made by one of our ambassadors](https://bldstackingnode.medium.com/monitoring-substrate-node-polkadot-kusama-parachains-validator-guide-922734ea4cdb#efff), [Polkadot Wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-guides-how-to-monitor-your-node), [W3F secure validator repo](https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-secure-validator). Creating the ultimate guide to secure your validator.

## Understanding

A validator or collator in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem plays an essential role in Plasm/Shiden network and is responsible for crucial tasks, including block production and transaction confirmation. A validator needs to maintain a high communication response capability to ensure seamless operation of the network. It is also necessary for them to establish a good reputation in the community to attract more nominators who nominate their tokens to improve the networkâ€™s security. Based on network affordability and security considerations, validator seats will gradually open after the launch of Plasm/Shiden. In the future, we aim to have 100 validator seats on Plasm and 100 seats on Shiden.

As a future validator, it's very important that you know what you are doing. I don't want to encourage you to move forward but it's important to understand that running a validator comes with responsibility. Also, who doesn't want to learn something new? Reading, learning, understanding, and setting things up would take between **2-4 hours**. 

**The final setup will look like this:**
