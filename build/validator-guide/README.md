# Validator Guide

Currently, Plasm has 2 networks, [Dusty Network](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Dusty), and [Plasm Network](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Plasm). 

Dusty Network is our testnet. The stable validators on Dusty can be the first validators on Plasm mainnet. Plasm is looking for 100 validators on the Plasm Network.

Join our Validator [channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/Z3nC9U4) to find out the latest news and if new validators are accepted. 



To run a validator node follow these steps:

{% page-ref page="setup-server.md" %}

{% page-ref page="install-node.md" %}

{% page-ref page="configure-node.md" %}

If you are already a validator you need to keep your node live and updated in order to prevent slashing of your staked funds. Please try to create a very secure validator by following this guide:

{% page-ref page="secure-validator/" %}
