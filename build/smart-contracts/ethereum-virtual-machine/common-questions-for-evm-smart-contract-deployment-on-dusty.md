# FAQ for EVM smart contract deployment on Dusty

* **Is there a step by step guide on how to deploy smart contract on Dusty?**
  * yes, please follow [this tutorial ](ethereum-contract-on-dusty-network.md)in our documentation
* **Can I use** [**Remix**](http://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js) **for smart contract deployment on Dusty?**
  * yes of course.
* **Can I use** [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/) **for smart contract deployment on Dusty?**
  * yes, please follow [this tutorial](../../../integration/using-hardhat.md) in our documentation
* **Can I use Truffle for smart contract deployment on Dusty?**
  * unfortunately at the moment you canâ€™t use Truffle
  * when Shiden network is launched as Kusama parachain, you will be able to use Truffle
  * please use [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) until then
* **What is the name of the native token on Dusty**
  * PLD
* **How do I connect to Dusty testnet**
  * The best is to use Metamask and set Custom RPC
  * Network Name: Dusty
  * New RPC URL: [https://rpc.dusty.plasmnet.io:8545](https://rpc.dusty.plasmnet.io:8545/)
  * Chain ID: 80
  * Currency Symbol: PLD
  * or check this [guide](https://docs.astar.network/integration/metamask/adding-networks) 
* **How can I get test tokens \(PLD\)?**
  1. copy your metamask address \(a1\)
  2. swap to polkadot address [here](http://polkatools.hoonkim.me/index.html) \(a1 -&gt; a2\)
  3. use [faucet](https://plasm-faucet-frontend.vercel.app/) to send PLD to a2
* **I was given 1000 PLD by the faucet but my Metamask wallet shows 1**
  * Metamask uses 18 decimal places to represent PLD \(1 PLD is 1018 Units\), Polkadot uses 15 decimal places
  * this will be fixed on the mainnet
* **Is there a block explorer for Dusty**
  * At the moment there is no block explorer for Dusty
* **Is it possible to import Substrate \(Polkadot\) address to Metamask?**
  * No. Polkadot \(Substrate framework\) uses 256 bit address while Metamask uses 160 bit address
* **Can I interact with EVM contracts by using existing Dusty/Substrate account \(non-ecdsa\)?**
  * Any Substrate account could call EVM in Substrate, address will be mapped into EVM compatible representation
* **I was able to deploy contracts in other networks, but contracts deployed in this network shows "out of gas" error with the error code of 0. How do I fix it?**
  * Contract size limit may differ in the network, it is recommended to lower optimizer runs of the same smart contract for adjusting compatible size for the network. Please try testnet to tune it.
