Here is  a quick demo on how to use  EVM.

EVM \(Ethereum Virtual Machine\) is the most popular VM for smart contracts. EVM has a rich ecosystem for developers, testers, and users. **Plasm Network fully supports EVM-based smart contracts as L1 contracts.**

## Deploy your EVM smart contract

In this article, you will deploy a smart contract on the Plasm local development environment.

### Install a Plasm Node

To use a  local development environment, a Plasm node is necessary. Please install the latest Plasm node from here: [https://github.com/staketechnologies/Plasm/tree/dusty](https://github.com/staketechnologies/Plasm/tree/dusty) \([build instruction](https://github.com/staketechnologies/Plasm/tree/dusty#building-from-source)\).

The next step is to launch a node in the development environment.

```text
plasm-node --dev -l evm=debug
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  WARN Running in --dev mode, RPC CORS has been disabled.    
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  INFO Plasm Node                                                                                           
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  INFO ‚úåÔ∏è  version 1.6.0-1dc78cce-x86_64-linux-gnu    
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  INFO ‚ù§Ô∏è  by Stake Technologies <devops@stake.co.jp>, 2019-2020    
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  INFO üìã Chain specification: Development     
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  INFO üè∑  Node name: skillful-war-1171    
Oct 14 15:07:56.998  INFO üë§ Role: AUTHORITY
```

Now, the node is available on Metamask. Ta-da! Sounds good, doesn't it?

![Plasm development node. Metamask connection settings.](../../.gitbook/assets/network_connection.png)

The next step is to import the developer account seed:

> `0x60ed0dd24087f00faea4e2b556c74ebfa2f0e705f8169733b01530ce4c619883`

![Import developer account seed.](../../.gitbook/assets/import_dev_account.png)

![Imported account balance.](../../.gitbook/assets/account_imported.png)

Keep in mind that PLM is not ERC20! 

### Deploy contracts by using Remix

When the account is ready and corrected, it is time to deploy some sample contracts from Remix.

![Use Remix demo contract.](../../.gitbook/assets/remix_demo.png)

![Change deployment environment to Metamask injected web3 instance.](../../.gitbook/assets/change_env.png)

![Push &quot;deploy&quot; and approve transaction on Metamask.](../../.gitbook/assets/deploy%20%281%29.png)

If everything goes well in the Plasm node, you will see the following lines:

```

 `0x66bb595bc60c8af0a306aa86edf96a88d3a59e9a` is the contract instance address!

We will make a demo and make this much more user-friendly!
