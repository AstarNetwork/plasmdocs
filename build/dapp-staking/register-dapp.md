# Register dApp

How to register your dApp in our dApp store. First, you have to make sure that you meet the requirements:

{% hint style="info" %}
* **dApp staking is only for whitelisted projects** which joined our builder's program. In a later phase, this will be open to everyone through on-chain governance.
* To register a dApp, you need to have 100 SDN tokens + gas fee in your developer's wallet.
* Create/import your developer's wallet in the Polkadot JS extension.
{% endhint %}

When you meet the requirements, please get in touch with Maarten or Shun to whitelist your developer's account.&#x20;

### Step 1

Deploy your smart contract in the Shiden ecosystem. You have two options:

1. Use your smart contract.
2. Deploy our `helloworld.sol` contract and provide all the information in the header of the contract.

Template contract:

### Step 2

Go to our [portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps) and click on `+ Register dApp`:

{% embed url="https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps" %}

Provide all the information in the pop-up window and press register. Keep in mind that your account needs to be whitelisted, and you have 100 SDN in the wallet that is registering the dApp.&#x20;

When your dApp is deployed, we would appreciate it that you shared this with your community. We have created a template that you can use to write the article. You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xa1g3q1MYC8NkdrtEhr3KRgTMWVXd8rLKa5YLpkdVuw/edit?usp=sharing).
