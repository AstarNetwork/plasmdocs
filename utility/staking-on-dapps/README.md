### Step 3

_Add_: you can add more SDN in dApp staking.

_Unstake_: you can now claim your SDN back.

_Claim_: claim your rewards. Every ERA you can claim for your rewards, please note that it doesn't have to be you to press claim. If the dApp owner or anyone one else from the stake pool press claim, you also will get your ERA rewards.
