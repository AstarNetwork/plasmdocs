[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) is an open-source project led by the [Web3 Foundation](https://web3.foundation/). It is a sharded protocol that connects different blockchain networks.

### Polkadot Basics

Polkadot consists of two parts: Relaychain and Parachain.

* **Relaychain:** This is the core of Polkadot which is responsible for network security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.
* **Parachain:** These are sovereign blockchains with custom tokens and optimized functionality for specific use cases. Parachain connection to Relaychain is priced on a pay-as-you-go basis or a continuous connectivity lease.

[**Plasm Network**](https://www.plasmnet.io/) is built on Parity Substrate making it one of the first SCALABLE smart contract Polkadot Parachains.

Parachain and Relaychain in Polkadot makes the following things possible:

1. **Data and tokens can be transferred among parachains seamlessly.**
2. **Parachains can import Relaychain security.**

## Plasm Network and Polkadot

This section describes how the [Plasm Network ](https://www.plasmnet.io/) integrates to the Polkadot ecosystem. [Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) aims to be the first scalable smart contract Polkadot Parachain.

### Smart Contract

The [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) relay chain does not support smart contracts. Plasm will create this functionality also making it easily scalable. Developers are free to build a variety of dApps knowing that they can be scaled up with ease.

### Scalability

[Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/) scalability relies on layer 2 solutions such as the Optimistic Virtual Machine.

Scalability is the greatest challenge to all blockchains. To bring widespread adoption of blockchain technology, higher performance is necessary. Scalability is a critical issue that Plasm Network seeks to optimize.

Two Types Of Scalability

* **Layer 1 \(horizontal\) scalability:** do more on the layer 1 blockchain. \(e.g. sharding and Segwit\)
* **Layer 2 \(vertical\) scalability:** do less on layer 1 and more on layer 2 or off-chain. \(e.g. Plasma and State Channel\)

Polkadot uses sharding technology allowing greater scalability. [Plasm](https://www.plasmnet.io/) also incorporates layer 2 vertical capabilities. Layer 1 and layer 2 offer different yet complementary solutions.

Additional benefits of the Plasm Network architecture include:

* **First Finality**
* **Flexible dApps development**
* **Significantly lower transaction\(gas\) costs**

Smart contract capability combined with layer 2 architecture makes many interesting dApps possible on [Plasm Network](https://www.plasmnet.io/). \(e.g. Gaming, IoT, Payment, DEX, and Bridge\)
