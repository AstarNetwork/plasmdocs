# Builders & Grants Program

## Introduction

The Astar Builders Program was created to help further the development, growth, and adoption of our ecosystem by supporting teams who are building on it. The program is operated by Stake Technologies.

## Who and what are we looking for?

We are always focused on the community and on product development so we have designed the program in a similar fashion - we are interested in **high-quality teams** that are building **infrastructure/integrations to help our developers** and **applications that the community wants**. This can be broadly split into 2 different tracks, the infrastructure track, and the application track.

### Infrastructure Track

As the name suggests, the infrastructure track is an umbrella term to categorize all integrations or services that can help improve the adoption of the ecosystem. Some common examples include:

* developer tools (libraries, pallets, debugging tools, ...)
* infrastructure (custodians, bridges, explorer, ...)
* integration tools (oracles, indexer, ...)

### Application Track

The application track is geared primarily towards building dApps in the Astar ecosystem.

## Why should I apply for your Builders Program?

We understand that any talented teams will have no problems applying to other programs so aside from your typical financial support, we will also provide the following:

### Technical support

* In the onboarding phase, one of our business devs will walk your team through how to develop and maintain applications on Astar / Shiden Network (if required).
* We will set up a Telegram group between your team and us for you to ask any questions.
* Ad-hoc meetings can be arranged with the core team to get help on more complex technical problems.

### Network and Fundraising support

* We have access to a huge network of traditional/crypto investors, industry experts, blockchain mentors, exchanges, market makers etc. which we can link you up with to take your project to the next level.
* A very unique feature of the Astar / Shiden Network is dApps staking where developers can earn ASTR/SDN tokens by developing and deploying applications. These tokens can act as supplementary income for your team. **The better the performance of your dApp (determined by how many tokens are nominated to you), the more tokens you will receive from each block.** Please take a look at this [forum post](https://forum.astar.network/t/faq-what-is-dapps-staking/1247) for a more detailed explanation.

### Marketing support

* We can help to promote your project on our various social media platforms like Twitter, Telegram etc.
* You will also be invited to our community meetups and conferences as a guest speaker to share more about your project and to grow your community.
* We are a big fan of cross-collaboration between projects in the ecosystem and will help to connect your team with other projects in the Builders Program to create something amazing.

## Why build in the Astar ecosystem?

Aside from the Builders Program, there are 4 more compelling reasons why you would build on us instead of other smart contract enabled parachains.

1.  X-VM (cross virtual machine) interoperability

    Contracts deployed on EVM and WASM are interoperable. In fact, through [XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-crosschain/), we are also able to interact with other smart contracts on other parachains!
2.  Full Ethereum compatibility

    We support all major Ethereum development tools like MetaMask, Remix, Truffle, Hardhat etc. so deploying contracts on Astar / Shiden is as simple as changing the RPC URL!
3.  dApp staking

    As mentioned [previously](https://github.com/PlasmNetwork/builders-program/tree/update-with-new-workflow#network-and-fundraising-support), dApps staking is a unique feature of Astar / Shiden Network. There are no other parachains that naively support dApp developers!
4.  Scalable from the get-go

    If your application requires a much higher throughput, you can easily take advantage of one of the layer 2 modules e.g. Plasma, OVM, or ZK rollups that we offer!

## How to apply?

* Fill in our application [form](https://share.hsforms.com/1UFPFJXq6S1SN-j1lyMrNIgc2ryh)
* You will receive an email with more information.&#x20;
* After your application is approved you will be informed of the next steps.

## FAQs

> The Builders Programs for both Astar Network and Shiden Network is live. We accept applications all year round.

#### What is the difference between Astar Network and Shiden Network?

> Shiden is to Astar what Kusama is to Polkadot. Shiden is our canary network.

#### Is this Builders Program for Astar Network or Shiden Network?

> The Builders Program is for both networks.

#### Are there any application fees?

> No.

#### What is the application process like?

> See the workflow.

#### How long will it take before I hear back from you?

> You should hear back from us within a few days after submitting your form.

#### Who is on the Builders Program Committee?

> The Builders Program currently consists of 8 members, 4 from the Astar team and 4 ambassadors from our community. These 8 individuals will pull together their unique skillset and experiences to perform a comprehensive evaluation of your application. Note that if a consensus cannot be reached, the default behaviour is to reject the application.

#### What makes a good application?

>
> There should be a detailed breakdown of this in your proposal.
