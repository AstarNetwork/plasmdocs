### Step 2

Look for your favorite project. You can click on the name to see more information about the project. Another great resource is looking in our [forum](https://forum.astar.network), check [DefilLama](https://defillama.com/chain/) or [DappRadar](https://www.dappradar.com).

To add your staking amount, just click on '**Stake**' in the box of your favorite project.

### Step 3

_**Add**_: you can add more tokens in dApp staking.

_**Unbond**_: here you can select how many tokens you want to unbond from your staked amount.

_**Claim** (top of page)_: claim your rewards from all dApps you staked on. Every ERA you can claim for your rewards, but we recommend doing this once every week.
