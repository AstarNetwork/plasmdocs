# Register dApp

How to register your dApp in our dApp staking mechanism. First, you have to make sure that you meet the requirements:

{% hint style="info" %}
* **dApp staking is for all live projects in our ecosystem**. Just apply to [this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1UFPFJXq6S1SN-j1lyMrNIgc2ryh) to be added to our dApp staking portal.
* To register a dApp, you need to have 100 SDN or 1000 ASTR tokens + gas fee in your developer's wallet.
* Create/import your developer's wallet in the Polkadot JS extension.
{% endhint %}

### Step 1

Deploy a smart contract in our ecosystem. Deploy on Shiden if you want to join Shiden dApp staking, deploy on Astar for joining Astar dApp staking. You have two options for a smart contract:

1. Use your smart contract.
2. Deploy our `helloworld.sol` contract and provide all the information in the header of the contract.

Template contract:

### Step 2

Go to our [portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps) and click on `+ Register dApp`:

{% embed url="https://portal.astar.network/#/store/discover-dapps" %}

Provide all the information in the pop-up window and press register. Keep in mind that your account needs to be **whitelisted**, and you have the needed tokens in the wallet that is registering the dApp.&#x20;

When your dApp is deployed, we would appreciate it if you shared this with your community. We have created a template that you can use to write the article. You can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xa1g3q1MYC8NkdrtEhr3KRgTMWVXd8rLKa5YLpkdVuw/edit?usp=sharing).
