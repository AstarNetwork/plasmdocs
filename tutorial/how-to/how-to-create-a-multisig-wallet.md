* Go to Accounts -> +Multisig
* From the available signatories, select the ones that you want to include in the multisig.

* Give the multisig wallet a name.
* Click "Create".

* To test the multisig wallet, it is recommended to first use Shibuya testnet. You can get SBY faucet from [https://portal.astar.networ](https://portal.astar.networ) by connecting your own wallet.
* After getting the SBY faucet, send the SBY tokens to the multisig wallet and then you can start playing around.
