# How to Transfer ASTR/SDN from Polkadot.js to Metamask

In this tutorial, I am going to explain how to transfer ASTR/SDN from Polkadot.js to Metamask. Astar is Ethereum compatible layer1 blockchain. You are able to manage your ASTR/SDN on your Metamask.&#x20;

### Step1: Connect Metamask Automatically

Please visit [our portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/balance/wallet) and choose Metamask to log in.

### Step2: Transfer ASTR/SDN from Polkadot.js to Metamask

The default Astar address is Polkadot native. Therefore, you need to transfer ASTR from Polkadot native address to Ethereum address. First, please log out the portal and log in with your Polkadot.js account.&#x20;
