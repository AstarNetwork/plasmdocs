# How to Transfer ASTR/SDN from Exchanges

Currently, $ASTR is listed on OKX, Huobi, Gate, and KuCoin. One of the FAQs from our community is how to withdraw $ASRT from exchanges. In this tutorial, I will explain how to do it.&#x20;

### Step1: Go to exchange and click "withdraw"

### Step2: Check out Astar native address

Astar supports both Polkadot native virtual machine and Ethereum virtual machine. Therefore, Astar has 2 different addresses. We are trying to make our user experience as easy as possible. If you have any feedback, please send us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uNUN9Vxak2).&#x20;

Please go to the[ Astar portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/balance/wallet) and connect your Polkadot.js. If you haven't installed Polkadot.js, please do install from [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

Please make sure to click **"Native" address**. This is your address that you should use when you withdraw ASTR from exchanges.
