# How to send ASTR/SDN from exchanges to our portal

Currently, $ASTR and $SDN are listed on tier 1 exchanges. One of the FAQs from our community is how to withdraw the token from exchanges.

### Step1: Go to exchange and click "withdraw"

### Step2: Use Astar native address

Astar supports both Polkadot native virtual machine and Ethereum virtual machine. Therefore, Astar has 2 different addresses. We are trying to make our user experience as easy as possible. If you have any feedback, please send us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uNUN9Vxak2).&#x20;

Please go to the[ Astar portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/balance/wallet) and connect your Polkadot.js. If you haven't installed Polkadot.js, please do install from [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/).

Once you connect to the Astar portal, you will be able to see your address and amount.

![Copy Native Address](<../.gitbook/assets/image (131) (1).png>)

Make sure to copy your **Native** address. This is your address that you should use when you withdraw ASTR/SDN from exchanges.
