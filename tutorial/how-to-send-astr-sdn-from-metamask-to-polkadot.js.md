# How to send ASTR/SDN from MetaMask to Polkadot.js

## <mark style="color:red;">**WARNING - WHEN YOU ARE ON EVM MODE, DO NOT SEND TOKENS FROM METAMASK TO EXCHANGES!!**</mark>

### Step1: Connect Metamask  and Transfer

Please visit [our portal](https://portal.astar.network/#/balance/wallet) and select the network you want to use.\
**Astar Network**: Polkadot parachain\
**Shiden Network**: Kusama parachain

When you have chosen your network, you can connect your wallet. The moment you select MetaMask it will automatically switch to our network.&#x20;

Click "Confirm" and sign the transaction on Metamask.

### Step 2: Withdraw EVM Deposit

Disconnect Metamask from the portal and connect the Polkadot.js wallet that you sent the ASTR/SDN tokens to.

You will be able to see the "EVM Deposit" balance.&#x20;

Click on "Withdraw EVM Deposit" and sign the transaction on Polkadot.js. You need gas to perform this transaction. If you do not have any gas, click on "Faucet".



Your ASTR/SDN is now in your native Polkadot.js wallet.&#x20;
