# About Generalized Plasma

## PGSpec

Plasma PGSpec is the latest Plasma standard specification by the Plasma Group, an organization that is trying to define the Plasma standard specification. The official name is "Plasma Group â€™s Generalized Plasma Specification".

The official specifications of PGSpec can be found here. [https://docs.plasma.group/projects/spec/en/latest]

Until now, Plasma could only build a PlasmaChain that could only be used for very limited purposes. (For example, payments or asset exchanges). None of these are as versatile as smart contracts. The Plasma Group designed a more general Plasma Chain specification. This makes it possible to develop a Plasma Chain that can be used not only for currency exchange but also for a wide range of fields, such as handling games and financial products.

The reason why we can develop products that follow Plasma's latest specifications is that we have partnered with Cryptoeconomics Lab, which has the most advanced plasma research and development in Japan. I would like to thank all of them that they have been working with Plasma Group to develop Plasma standards and have been able to lubricate the development of our Plasm PGSpec.

## OVM
The Plasma Group is researching and developing an abstract language structure OVM that expresses all Layer2 solutions.
We will implement the OVM implementation in Plasm in the future.
