# Generalized Plasma

## PGSpec
Plasma PGSpec is the latest Plasma standard specification proposed by the Plasma Group. The official name is "Plasma Group â€™s Generalized Plasma Specification".

The official specifications of PGSpec can be found [here.](https://docs.plasma.group/projects/spec/en/latest)

Before PGSpec, Plasma can be used for the limited purposes like payments and asset exchanges. None of these designs are as versatile as smart contracts.  The Plasma Group designed a more general Plasma chain specification for more use cases. This makes it possible to develop a Plasma Chain that can be used not only for currency exchange but also for a wide range of use cases, such as handling games and financial products. 

## OVM
The Plasma Group is researching and developing an abstract language structure, Optimictic VM that expresses all Layer2 solutions.
We will implement the OVM on Plasm in the future. This means that Plasm will be not only for Plasma but also for other layer2 scaling solutions.

## Word of Gratitude
We have a partnership with one of the most advancing Plasma implementors called [Cryptoeconomics Lab](https://www.cryptoeconomicslab.com/) We appreciate all the developments and contributions they have done in the plasma ecosystem.
