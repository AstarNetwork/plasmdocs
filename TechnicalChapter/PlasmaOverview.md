# Plasma Overview
We will walk through the basic functions of Plasma on this page.

Plasma is one of the blockchain scaling solutions invented by Joseph Poon Poon and Vitalik Buterin. [White paper](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf)

Plasma is a framework to make a side chain and connect it to a main chain (e.g. Ethereum). The side chain and the main chain communicate each other.  

## Why Plasma?
Blockchains are slow and expensive by design. Blockchains can't be an infrastructure of the world without an high scalability. We, Plasma implementors try to make it fast and cheap without sacrifycing safety and decentralization so that everyone can use blockchains. 

## Hierarchical Structure
Plasma has an hierarchical stracture which consists of a parant chain and child chains. The top of these chains is called the root chain (e.g. Ethereum) Traditionally, public blockchain processses all transactions on the first layer. However, this mechanism doesn't scale because of the limited capacity and capability. Therefore, the second layer, the Plasma child chains is used as a transaction layer.
