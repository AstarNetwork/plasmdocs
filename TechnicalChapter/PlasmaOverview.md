## About Plasma
Plasma is a blockchain scale solution.

There are several solutions for scaling blockchains. For example, a solution that compresses the block size, such as Segwit, a state channel that allows users to combine several transactions off-chain and describe only the final state in the blockchain, and sharding that distributes transactions on multiple nodes , And Plasma that saves only the root hash in the main chain by transacting to another chain.

The reason we focused on Plasma is that Plasma is a scalable solution that is the least dependent on the processing performance of the main chain. In Plasma, an operator called a single operator operates the side chain. This means that many transactions can be handled in a centralized way that does not require a consensus process. It means that the scale solution used in the existing centralized system can be used as it is, so it is possible to achieve high processing performance that is not possible with a distributed ledger. Plasma's approach can be said to become an indispensable technology in the future because it can dramatically improve processing performance for all distributed ledgers.
